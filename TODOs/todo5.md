### Create Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) connectivity
Java is one of the most powerful and popular server-side languages in the current scenario. One of the main features of a server-side language is the ability to communicate with the databases. There are two ways of connecting to the database - JDBC and Hibernate (using ORM framework).


Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming ability to convert data from object type to relational type and vice versa. The main feature of ORM is mapping or binding an object to its data in the database. While mapping we have to consider the data, type of data and its relations with its self-entity or entity in any other table.

### Requirements
1. Create a package and a class inside it for the ORM connection.
2. Import the javax servlet library packages (if not auto downloaded). Check below to find more about javax servlet imports-
- [Java Servlet API Dependencies](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.servlet/javax.servlet-api)
3. Write the code in the ORM java class. Check how to create a ORM class-
- [Create ORM Class](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/orm.html)
4. Provide the JDBC url and driver path.
5. Similarly provide the connection details, i.e.- username and password.

Congratulations!!! You have completed the ORM connection!

### Tip
You can use an online database builder as well. For that you don't need to install any MySQL Workbench or Oracle SQL Developer for that instance. Check it out-

### Bring It On!
You can also use a file to write and read data instead of using any database. For this you don't need any ORM connectivity. Find it out!

### Expected Outcome
On success, your web project will be connected to the database you are working with
