### Run the web application on localhost
After several hours of design, coding and testing, your application is ready to be published. As it is a web application, it requires an HTTP server to host it. Apache Tomcat server will manage to do it. Itâ€™s an open-source program that processes HTTP requests to access the files stored within a server. These files can be static (it means that whenever a client asks for it they will be shared as they are) or dynamic (before sending files to the client they are generated by the software hosted on a server). In short, Tomcat handles communication via HTTP protocol and delegates requests to the Spring MVC application.

### Requirements
1. Build the project. There are two ways to build a project-

- From the IDE terminal
- From the CMD

Open the command (CMD) terminal. Go to the path where the project is residing. Run the below command-

`mvn clean install`

2. Create a WAR file. If built from IDE. You need to manually build a war file.
  - [Create a WAR file](https://dzone.com/articles/generating-war-file-plain)
3. Run the tomcat server from IDE or independently
- From IDE. [Define and run application server](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-and-managing-application-server-integration.html)

Else keep the WAR file on the tomcat webapps folder and click on start.bat file present in the bin folder.
- [Deploy web application through Tomcat](https://www.webucator.com/how-to/how-deploy-web-application-using-the-apache-tomcat-manager-windows.cfm)

4. Write down the web URL and start your web application.

`https://localhost:<port number>/<home page name>.html/`

Congratulations!!! Your application is running successfully!
