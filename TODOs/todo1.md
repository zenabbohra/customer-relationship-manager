### Setting up the development environment
First off you need to set up the development environment for the web application project. For a java web development project, you need to install Java and Maven. Additionally you need a code-editor or IDE to write the code, configure a database to store the data and finally configure a local server to host the application.

### Requirements
- Install Java (openJDK 15)
- Install Gradle
- Install IntelliJ (Community edition)
- Install Tomcat 6 or higher to run the web application locally
- Do the environment setup for Java and Gradle on your local machine
- Feel free to change the server running PORT if needed

Check the versions of java and maven to know whether you have successfully installed it or not-

`java -version`

`gradle -v`

Congratulations!!! Your initial set up is done!
